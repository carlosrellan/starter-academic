I am an Emergia Fellow (Junta de Andalucía) at Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Granada (Spain) and PI of the <strong>[Project ARPA](https://proyectos.ugr.es/arpa/)</strong> (<em>"Computational Analysis of exchange networks in Andalusian Late Prehistory"</em>) and the <strong>ANDALUSIL project</strong> (<em>"Procurement strategies and production processes of sillimanite polished tools during the Late Prehistory of Andalusia"</em>).

My research interests deal with the study of polished and knapped lithic industries. Furthermore, I am also interested on the analysis of long distance networks during Late Prehistory and on prehistoric open-air rock art.
